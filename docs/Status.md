## Known Issues

- `mac_control` brightness fallback only works if `brightness` CLI is installed (`brew install brightness`)
- Spotify `play_track` search requires `SPOTIFY_TOKEN` in `.env`; without it, falls back to opening a Spotify URI search
- `web_search` uses DuckDuckGo Instant Answers — works well for facts/people, weak on recent news
- `file_manager` find_file skips `Library/` and `.Trash` but can be slow on large home dirs
- Multi-step tool chains fully supported — `think()` loops until Claude returns plain text
- Wake word uses `"hey siri"` built-in keyword (closest phonetically) — can be replaced with a custom "Hey SARA" keyword via Picovoice Console (paid or custom tier)
- `screen_context` captures the full display — on multi-monitor setups it captures only the primary screen
